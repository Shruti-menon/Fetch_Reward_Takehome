Take Home Examination for Data Analyst position 
Step 1:
Performed analysis using Python on the three tables (Product, User and Transaction)

First: Explore the Data
Review the unstructured csv files and answer the following questions with code that supports your conclusions:
1. Are there any data quality issues present?
2. Are there any fields that are challenging to understand?

Refer to the file 01 - Data Exploration.sql and 02 - Data Quality Issues.pdf

Second: provide SQL queries
Answer three of the following questions with at least one question coming from the closed-ended and one from the open-ended question set. Each question should be answered using one query.

Closed-ended questions:
1. What are the top 5 brands by receipts scanned among users 21 and over?
2. What are the top 5 brands by sales among users that have had their account for at least six months?
3. What is the percentage of sales in the Health & Wellness category by generation?

Open-ended questions: for these, make assumptions and clearly state them when answering the question.
1. Who are Fetchâ€™s power users?
2. Which is the leading brand in the Dips & Salsa category?
3. At what percent has Fetch grown year over year?

Refer to the file 03 - Closed_EndedQueries.sql for Closed ended questions

Refer to the file 04 - Open_EndedQueries.sql for Open ended questions

Third: Communicate with stakeholders

Construct an email or slack message that is understandable to a product or business leader who is not familiar with your day-to-day work. Summarize the results of your investigation. Include:

Key data quality issues and outstanding questions about the data

One interesting trend in the data
    
  Use a finding from part 2 or come up with a new insight

Request for action: explain what additional help, info, etc. you need to make sense of the data and resolve any outstanding issues

Refer to the file 05 - Email to the Stakeholder.pdf
